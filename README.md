# 🧮 Insertion Sort in C++

A simple **Insertion Sort program** in C++ that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

---

## ⚡ Features

* ✅ Sorts an array using the **insertion sort algorithm**
* ✅ Handles **dynamic array input**
* ✅ Shows **sorted array** clearly
* ✅ Easy to understand and extend for learning purposes

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Take input from the user for the **size of the array**.
2. Accept **array elements** from the user.
3. Perform **insertion sort** using a temporary array.
4. Display the **sorted array** on the console.

---

## 📋 Example

**Input:**

```
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter 5 integer values: 4 2 5 1 3
```

**Output:**

```
Sorted array: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a **C++ compiler** installed (like `g++`).
2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ insertion_sort.cpp -o insertion_sort
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./insertion_sort
   ```
